# M9k Remastered

**Workshop: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2169649722**

# Description:

M9k: Remastered is a massive improvement over the original M9k addons.

We dumped the original code and then made new modern code for maximum performance.

⠀

This addon includes all original base packs.

( Small arms, Heavy weapons, Assault rifles, Specialties pack. )

⠀

This addon can be used exclusively for the resources.

( Models, materials, sounds, etc.. )

⠀

**For the best experience we recommend avoiding playing in Singleplayer.**
**Start a Multiplayer session instead.**

\> The addon was designed with Multiplayer in mind just like 99% of other addons.

\> We made it compatible with Singleplayer, but you might run into issues.

# Compatibility

M9k: Remastered is **not** compatible with original/legacy M9k addons.

Weapons and packs have to be coded specifically for M9k: Remastered to function properly.

⠀

**All non-M9k: Remastered packs have to be removed.**

# Console Commands:

**More commands will be added later.**

Most of these commands can only be used through the **server console**.

Commands | Description | ⠀ | ⠀
:--|:--|:--|:--
m9k_balancemode | Disable/Enable Remastered Balance.	| 0 = Legacy | 1 = Remastered
m9k_spawn_with_ammo | Disable/Enable Remastered Balance.	| 0 = Legacy | 1 = Remastered
m9k_spawn_with_reserve | Disable/Enable Giving Ammo on pickup.	| 0 = No Ammo | 1 = 3 Magazines on Equip
m9k_zoomstages | Disable/Enable Zoomstages on weapons.	| 0 = One zoom level | 1 = Multiple zoom levels
m9k_zoomtoggle | Disable/Enable Zoomtoogle on weapons.	| 0 = Hold to zoom | 1 = Toggle to zoom/unzoom
m9k_lefthanded | Disable/Enable lefthanded weapons.	| 0 = Right-handed | 1 = Left-handed

# Roleplaying:

If you're using M9k: Remastered on your Roleplay server we recommend running the following commands:

- m9k_balancemode 1
- m9k_spawn_with_ammo 0
- m9k_spawn_with_reserve 0

These commands will make it so that Weapons spawn with no magazine and won't give the player ammo on picking them up.

The remastered balance mode is recommended as it makes gunplay more fair and fun for everyone.

# Features:

- Drastically improved code that now runs a lot faster and includes countless of bug fixes.
- Dynamic Weapon accuracy imitating recoil behavior from CS:S.
- Balance switch that allows you to use the legacy or the Remastered Weapon balance.
- You can un-scope by pressing the reload key. Holding it will reload the Weapon afterwards.
- c_hands are simulated wherever possible.
- Immersive sound handler. Every sound the gun makes is played for everyone else. (Deploy sounds, reload sounds, etc..)
- Adjusted firing sound volumes. Silenced Weapons are actually silenced and sniper rifles are loud.. etc..

Note: The "S" Bomb and Fists are not included as they're just.. not okay.
